# AML-Project

In this project, the objective was to develop create some modelsthat could distinguish between real images and fake images.

The models implemented were the following:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- k Nearest Neighbours (kNN)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Ensemble (with all the models above)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The results for F1-Score were the following:
- Logistic Regression: 72.4%
- Decision Tree: 95.8%
- Random Forest: 97.6%
- k Nearest Neighbours (kNN): 70.9%
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): 76.2%
- Gaussian Naive Bayes: 49.1%
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): 66.5%
- Ensemble: 91.5%
- Convolutional Neural Network (with the best parameters): 99.9%
